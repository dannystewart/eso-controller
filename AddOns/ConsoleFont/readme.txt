Instructions:
1. Extract the folder to Documents/Elder Scrolls Online/live/Addons/
2. If game is open, reload the UI using /reloadui, otherwise, start the game and enable
3. Enjoy!

Note:
The purpose of this addon is to emulate the Gamepad UI fonts and "feel" as much as possible as I personally prefer the Gamepad UI fonts.
You can, however, use this addon to change the font to one of your own liking by modifying the LUA file.
